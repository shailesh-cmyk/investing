# Value Investing Models
This repository is to develop investment utilities for use by value investors and to support resources at wordpress site. Utilities will include proprietary screeners, portfolio allocation models, risk assessment, portfolio rebalancing, etc. These could be perhaps linked via custom coded plugins for Wordpress.

The pages below describe my value investing philosophy that I plan to codify for use by other investors. With time I expect to build this into a comprehensive investment platform for both retail and professional value investors.
